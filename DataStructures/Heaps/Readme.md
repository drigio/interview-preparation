# Heaps

Heaps can be Min Heaps or Max Heaps.
Simple Heaps can be implemented using arrays.
Follows basic 2 principles :-

- The tree is complete binary tree or almost complete binary tree.
- Each child node is either greater / lesser than the parent element depending on min / max heap.

Priority Queues can be implemented using Heaps.

## Major Problems

1. Implementing Priority Queue.
2. Kth Largest Element in Array.
3. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences
4. Last Stone Weight

## Applications

- Priority Queues.
- Dynamic Memory Management.
- Heap Sort.
- Bandwidth management.

## Java Collection for Stack

### Stack<E>

1. Extends `Vector` class which is implemented as Last In First Out.
2. `Deque` should be preferred, using `ArrayDeque` instead of `Stack` class.
